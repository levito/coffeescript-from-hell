coffeescript-from-hell
======================

Title says it all, doesn't it?

Believe it or not: all of the snippets below are valid coffeescript and mostly compile into something weird...


## Some normal sentences that are totally valid coffeescript

```coffee
Drink a lot for yourself in the pub when you need it - me and my friends dont, do you?

do not try coffeescript if you have alcohol in your blood

throw the ball and try to catch it

do you know if this is the future?
```


## A little bit of "language" - "features"

```coffee
myFunction = (a,b,c) -> console.log a, b, c

# now, lets call this, right - great that we may skip the parentheses, right?
myFunction 1, 2, 3
myFunction a:1, b:2, c:3
myFunction 1, b:2, c:3
myFunction a:1, b, c
```
